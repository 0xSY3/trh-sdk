## Introduction

The tokamak rollup hub sdk allows anyone to quickly deploy customized and autonomous Layer 2 Rollups on the Ethereum network.

## Set up the SDK

- You must have go(1.20+ < 1.23) installed on your machine and `1.22.6` would be highly recommended. (Install go from [here](https://go.dev/doc/install))
- Clone the repository

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tokamak-network/trh-sdk.git
  ```

- Build the SDK
